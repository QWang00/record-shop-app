### The Brief

BritBeat Record shop has a [robust new API](https://github.com/QWang00/record-shop). It is a modern British record shop with two branches of the Android app. One branch, **iTunes-api-full-feature**, uses the iTunes API to retrieve album images based on the artist and album name. It includes full features for adding, updating, deleting, and filtering albums. Another branch, **s3-image-upload** connects with a custom Spring Boot backend, where album images are uploaded to AWS S3, and the image URL is returned.
